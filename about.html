            <p>During my time at Lehman I've learned programming through Java but I made the effort on my own to start learning Python as well. 
                This semester through this course I'll become more familiar with Javascript to enhance my knowledge as full stack developer. 
                I believe being an engineer is having the ability to critically analyze a problem in order to create an efficient solution that 
                meets the requested requirements. </p>
